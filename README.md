The RODENT is an extremly lightweight application for creating custom files for any os.
The application contains an entry box, at the very top, there you are required to enter
the directory you want the file to be saved to, a path button which triggers a file 
dialog has been placed there to aid you with this. 

Next there is another input box in which you are required to enter ONLY the file title, 
beside it is another that allows you to enter the extension type, after.

After entering all these information, you can click the create button and a file should 
be created for you in your intended location, this should take not more than 2 seconds to
create.

Contact the developer at rynstheoverlord@gmail.com if you encounter any issues.
